0.10

Updated to work with libmpd 0.6.* and xmonad-0.10.

Added new module: XMonad.Util.WindowPropertiesRE


0.9.2

Address hackage build failure.


0.9.1

This is mainly a compatibility release, because I forgot to add upper
version bounds on the dependencies in the previous release, which
caused a build failure due to a new version of the libmpd-bindings.

This version also adds XMonad.Config.Alt by Adam Vogt, a new,
experimental approach to configuring xmonad that is intended to make
the configuration simpler, more modular and to address difficulties
that arise when enabling multiple extensions.


0.9

The xmonad-extras package which contains some additional functionality
that requires additional dependencies is now on Hackage:

http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-extras-0.9

It includes a prompt for MPD, volume control and a way to evaluate
Haskell expression at runtime, similar to Emacs' eval feature.

If anyone has some modules or ideas that can't go in contrib due to
dependencies, patches and/or suggestions are always welcome.
